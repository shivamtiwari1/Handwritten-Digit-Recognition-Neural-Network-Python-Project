🧠 Neural Network Python Project: Handwritten Digit Recognition
This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a neural network designed to recognize handwritten digits using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. It is an excellent beginner project for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and neural networks.<br>

🔍 Project Overview<br>
The goal of this project is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The MNIST dataset is used as a standard benchmark for training and testing. The project begins by loading and normalizing the dataset to ensure effective training.<br>

A simple feedforward neural network is built from scratch with one hidden layer. The training process uses backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent to minimize the error by adjusting weights and biases. The model is then evaluated on test data to determine its accuracy.<br>

This project avoids using high-level machine learning libraries for the core logic, focusing instead on teaching how neural networks function under the hood. It’s ideal for students, hobbyists, or anyone beginning their machine learning journey.<br>
