# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Neural-Network-Python-Project
This Python project builds a neural network from scratch to identify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training with backpropagation, and accuracy evaluationâ€”perfect for those starting out in machine learning and neural networks.
